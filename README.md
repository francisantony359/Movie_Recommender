# Movie_Recommender
Using Movie_lens data to create a Recommender Engine
The final model for the best recommender system utilizes the Popular algorithm, 
which recommends 10 movies for a particular user. 
The best algorithm will be the one that has the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE), 
mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). As it can been seen in the summarized table 
and graph above, the Popular algorithm has resulted in an RMSE of 0.914, MSE of 0.836, 
and MAE of 0.681, which are the lowest error rates of the five methods. 
In addition, the Popular algorithm has the highest true positive rate compared to the other three UBCF methods.
